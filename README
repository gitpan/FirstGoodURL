NAME
    FirstGoodURL - determines first successful URL in list

SYNOPSIS
      use FirstGoodURL;
      use strict;

      my @URLs = (...);
      my $match;

      if ($match = FirstGoodURL->in(@URLs)) {
        print "good URL: $match\n";
      }
      else {
        print "no URL was alive\n";
      }

      if ($match = FirstGoodURL->with('image/png')->in(@URLs)) {
        print "PNG found at $match\n";
      }
      else {
        print "no PNG found\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the LWP suite to scan through a list of URLs.
    It returns the first URL that returns a `200 Ok' status. In
    addition, you can specify a Content-type that the URL must
    return.

Methods
    * `FirstGoodURL-'in(...)>
        Scans a list of URLs for a 200 response code, and possibly a
        requisite Content-type (see the `with' method below)

    * `FirstGoodURL-'with(...)>
        Sets a Content-type for the next (successful) call to `in'.
        You can send a single string, a list of strings, or a
        compiled regex (using `qr//'). If a match is returned from
        the call to `in', the Content-type is forgotten; if there is
        no match found, the Content-type is remembered. This method
        returns the class name, so that you can daisy-chain calls
        for readability:

          my $match = FirstGoodURL->with(qr/image/)->in(@URLs);
